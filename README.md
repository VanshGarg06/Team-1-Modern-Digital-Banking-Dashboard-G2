## Description of Modern Digital Banking Dashboard
We are building a personal digital banking dashboard, like what users see in
modern banking or finance applications.
A user should be able to:
- Log in securely
- Add multiple bank accounts
- View transactions
- Categorize spending
- Set budgets
- Track bills
- View rewards
- Receive alerts
- See financial insights
This is not a toy project. It mirrors real-world systems used in fintech products.
